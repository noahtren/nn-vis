below are some notes to myself about this project, which is a WIP

## Neural Architecture Visualization
I am interested in visualizing different neural architectures. It seems
that a good starting point for this would be using JavaScript libraries
to create force directed graphs of neural network wirings.

I could begin with visualizing existing neural architectures
including Dense neural networks, convolutions, and ResNet. What
is easy is that each network can be represented simply by a graph,
perhaps with the added detail of the weight between each layer.

## JS
I can use this library for 3D Graphing: https://github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph

## Vocab
**Directed Acyclic Graph** - a graph that only goes forwards and
nodes never reference previous nodes in the graph.
